            <p><em>How do we conceptualize digital materiality?</em> Python scripts documenting digital preservation through decomposition. A representation of data loss emerges by removing vector data from letterforms. Framing digital objects as computational amalgomations works to question the status of artifacts and their renderings. As data points disappear, the output communicates a shift based on legibility and perception.</p>
            <p>Intentional decay becomes an act of represenation, documenting the process of loss rather than the stable object. The resulting forms become records of their own loss. This project emerged from Drawbot expirements during Cooper Union's 2024 Summer Sessions Workshop.</p>
