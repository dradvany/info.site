            <h2>Digital Decay Type Rendering, 2024</h2>

            <p><i>How do we conceptualize digital materiality?</i> Python scripts documenting digital preservation through decomposition. A representation of data loss emerges by removing vector data from letterforms. As data points disappear, the output communicates a shift based on legibility and perception.</p>
            
            <p>Intentional decay becomes an act of representation, documenting the process of loss rather than the stable object. This project emerged from Drawbot experiments during Cooper Union's 2024 Summer Sessions Workshop. Source code documentation is in-progress.</p>

            <h2>Generative Archiving Installation, 2023</h2>

            <p>An installation on the reproduction of cultural materials. Photographs, paintings, and poetry courtesy of <em>Zintis: The Quarterly American–Latvian Magazine for Art, Literature, and Science (1960–1965)</em> were digitized and preloaded as data in a Processing sketch. Interaction with a bespoke controller enabled editing over predetermined parameters. Input channels corresponded to specific variables within the creative environment determining grid size, text layout, and layering of images. </p>

            <p>Users collaborate in the reproduction of cultural artifacts through direct, physical engagement with archived content by subverting conventional design tools. Compositions were automatically saved and later printed. This capstone project was completed under guidance from <a href="https://djoshcook.com" target="_blank">D. Josh Cook</a> at Loyola University Chicago.</p>
